  I was watching a <a href="http://eviltrout.com/2014/12/22/watch-ember-tv.html">video</a> from a talk by Robin Ward at the Embergarten Saturday Symposium in 2014, and I was intrigued by his discussion about mixing Ember and TV.  In the past week, our cohort has been working within the Ember framework to build simple web applications that refresh on the client side without reloading the entire page.  In Robin's talk, he goes into detail about some of the history of browser applications before he gets to the TV part, so I will summarize some of the key points.
</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<ul>
  <li>There is only one point in civilization's history that connects everything together</li>
  <li>The problem: applications are platform specific</li>
  <li>The dream: universal applications (platform agnostic)
  <ul>
    <li>Java come close, but it is ultimately huge failure in accomplishing universal applications</li>
    <li>JavaScript is not the "hero we needed, but the one we deserved"</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>We now have platform that allows us to "write once, run anywhere"</li>
 <li>Robin doesn't like the term "Single Page Applications" and he prefers "Browser Applications"<ul>
   <li>It is same as describing car as "horseless carriage"</li>
   <li>It's describing what it isn't as opposed to what it is</li>
 </ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Browser Applications</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Has access to DOM</li>
    <li>Runs in web browser</li>
    <li>Written in JavaScript</li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <li>Ember</li>
    <li>Angular</li>
  </ul>

<h4>Examples:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Social: Gmail, Slack</li>
    <li>Games: 2048</li>
    <li>Video: Vine, Twitch</li>
    <li>Atom.io</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Ember and Televisions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Ember is great platform for writing browser applications</li>
    <li>TVs can run web browsers</li>
    <li>Ember should be great for writing an application that runs on a TV</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We are not talking about a smart TV, but more in the line of ChromeCast or Apple TV.  Using Ember allows us to use URLs, since you can pass a URL around from one device to another seamlessly.  In addition, if your TV application is linked up to a website, you can make updates to the application whenever you want.  Lastly, TVs are now run on phones, tablets, and other devices, so the concept of a television has evolved from the traditional sense of the word.  Here is a <a href="http://embertv.eviltrout.com/browse/root">demo</a> that Robin created in Ember.  While the demo is tested with a keyboard and mouse, it should theoretically simulate using a traditional remote control.

    Within Ember, Robin touches on using large fonts with <em>emphasis</em> markers.  In addition, each page (movies, tv shows,etc.) should have separate routes set in the router.  He stresses the use of Ember components to build out projects like the demo application posted above.  As technology continues to evolve, our views on traditional devices such as televisions must also evolve.  Ember has much more functionality than I even knew.
